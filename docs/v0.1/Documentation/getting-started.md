## Whats TRUST&TRACE?

TRUST&TRACE helps companies to operate efficiently and sustainably by creating a trustworthy digital business network in which autonomous business partners can securely share the provenance and properties of their products. All relevant data across the supply chain is made available in a confidential yet auditable manner. Thus, it can be used consistently along the line from supply quality management to procurement to corporate communications and social responsibility.

Trustworthiness is realized by transferring trust from the real world to the digital world. This is guaranteed by independent trusted third parties who digitally confirm company data, certificates and regulatory compliance and in return expand their existing business model digitally.

TRUST&TRACE is a digital ecosystem in which trust-issuers and trust-takers work together to strengthen their business models while securing their autonomy. It is the digital driver to bridge organizations’ data silos across product supply chains. In times of growing demands for responsible action, we want to enable companies that are at the forefront of digitization to improve their excellence. They may do so by adopting straightforward ways to prove their products’ authenticity and compliance with sustainability, quality and environmental standards across the entire supply chain. Being excellent and able to react quickly is a desire for every company.

TRUST&TRACE offers its services in two categories: manage trust and trace transactions.

### Services to manage TRACE transactions

**Business Identity Management**

With Business Identity, data of your own company can be maintained in a secure place to share it later with business partners. Only you have access to your company’s data and the right to determine with whom you would like to share your data.

**Business Connect**

Invite your business partners to share data with you. In this way, all cooperation partners always have access to the latest company data, such as master data, quality and environmental certificates or company documents, and can significantly speed up administrative processes in supplier management.

**Compliance Management**

Ensuring compliance with industry specific regulations also includes checking the compliance of the business partners involved. With TRUST&TRACE Compliance Management, you can invite your business partners to share the required information and certificates and monitor if they are up-to-date and track all changes.

### Services to manage TRUST

**Order Visibility**

You can only meet the requirements of your customers if suppliers ensure their delivery reliability. With TRUST&TRACE Order Visibility, you create transparency in order processing between you and your supplier. Along a multi-stage order process, all parties involved are always kept up to date.

**Digital Product Identity \(PID\)**

With TRUST&TRACE Digital Product Identity \(PID\) every real-world asset receives a digital life. The digital identity exists independent from the data silos of the individual actors in a neutral, manufacturer-independent infrastructure. Thus, data and digital services of several stakeholders can be linked to the physical product throughout its entire life cycle.

**Product Tracing**

You can trace the provenance and relevant data for every physical asset across its lifecycle. With TRUST&TRACE Product Tracing, product-related data from several actors can be documented on the Product Identity in a tamper-proof and trustworthy manner. This ensures that compliance requirements and quality standards are met and helps to reduce service costs.

excerpt: "To communicate with secured messages over the DIDCOMM protocol, a DID exchange, including communication aggreements and public key pair exchange is necessary. To do so, [create a contact](https://docs.trust-trace.com/reference#create-a-contact) and pass the reference into the invitation call. A invitation E-Mail will be sent to the contact, with a specific invitation token. After the invitation was sent, the data object of the invitation action contains the generated invitation token and a specific invitation object. You can also use this one, to sent the token on every other way to your partner. Usually, the partner can accept the invitation via the TRUST&TRACE UI [http://app.trust-trace.com/request/accept/:invitationToken](http://app.trust-trace.com/request/accept/:invitationToken). But the other party can also use the action API to [answer a invitation request](https://docs.trust-trace.com/reference#post_action-invitation-answer)."

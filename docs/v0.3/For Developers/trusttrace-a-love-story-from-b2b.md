This sections covers use cases you may encounter often when working with the TRUST&TRACE API.

Remember, that you will need to have a valid authentication token, so why not start with the [Login and receive a JWT Token]?

# Registration

In case you are not registered, there is currently no API endpoint available to cover this, so head over to [TRUST&TRACE] and [register] your account. Actually, while you're at it, create two accounts. The examples here will focus on communication between them. It only takes a few seconds and you're ready to use the API. :)

# Login

Assuming you already have accounts or you just registered new ones, you can now head over to [Login and receive a JWT Token]. This section describes how to get authentication tokens, that you will need for the other sections.

# Contact handling

Feeling a bit lonely with your new accounts? No worries, we have sections, that describe how you can [Create a Contact]. This is a rather one-sided relationship as long as you don't [Invite a Contact], so have a look at this section as well to get your business partners on board.

# Handling credentials and presentations

So you're logged in and got a business partner to interact with. Now we can start with the cool stuff and [Create a Credential], which you then can use to [Create a Presentation] to [Send it to a Contact].

P.S. We shall be using Alice and Bob, as the two parties, in the examples presented in this document.

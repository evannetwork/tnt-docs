# Sample requests

We collected a set of request presets, that matches all usecases explained within the [TRUST&TRACE - A love story from B2B] section.

TODO:

- How to use the postman collection?
- Which parameters are used?

- Download the [POSTMAN collection]
- Download all [requests based on nodejs]

# Sample Agent

To get a quick and easy start in TRUST&TRACE with some prebuilt helper functions, you can use our tnt-agent project, that wraps the API into a [kick start project].

- configuration for endpoints, users and webhooks
- easy login and request handling
- auto ensuring webhook settings
- auto ensuring credential templates and credential definitions
- plugin handling

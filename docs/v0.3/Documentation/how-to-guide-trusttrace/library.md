We would like to give you some tools to evaluate and organize your data in TRUST&TRACE. 

This part is your "vault, library, data storage" of your data in TRUST&TRACE. 
Here you can find all your added data. Every time you change your data, this version will be saved in your library. This means you might have hundreds of entries in your library. Expired certificates, address changes etc. To make it easier for you we display the last version of a data entry. If you like you can enable the "expert-view" too see all entered changes.

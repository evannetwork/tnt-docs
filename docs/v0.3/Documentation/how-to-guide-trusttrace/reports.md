Reports are an exclusive tool on TRUST&TRACE, which enables users to aggregate data from an infinite number of suppliers down their supply chain. This data can be used to visualize and analyze your supply chain, hence making it more transparent.

To create a report for supplier you first need to choose a report name, which reflects the context you want to depict. For example, a report named "Jeans" will give you and your relevant partners the necessary mutual context, on which further interaction is based on.

To create a Report, you have to do the following steps:

  * Choose the data that should be included into this report (Master Data, Compliance Data)
  * Assign all suppliers/partners that are necessary to deliver goods for your context (e.g., "Jeans")
  * Submit the request to your suppliers with the missing data for this report.
  * You can check if data has been shared by clicking on the activity stream entry.

The last step before the request will be send to your partners is a summary. Here you can see what data has already been shared with you of your tier-1 partner. Your partner will get different requests to answer. 

In our example case the partner already shares master data with us, so he wonâ€™t get a new request for that. But he did not share the compliance data and his suppliers with us so he will get 2 separate requests.
 * Compliance Request
 * Report Request

To answer a Report Request, you need information from your suppliers that are involved with this client. The report name gives the necessary context to choose relevant contacts and data to answer the request with. For example a Supplier Report Request for "Jeans" might require to specify two contacts, providing you with "Jeans Cloth" and "Zippers" respectively. 

To answer a Report Request, you have to do the following steps:
  * Invite all of your suppliers to the network
  * Select all suppliers that are necessary to deliver goods for a specific product to your client (initiator)
  * Set a context for your enquiries (e.g. a product number or description like "Zipper") so that they can also provide you with relevant data.
  * Submit the request to your suppliers with the missing data for this report.

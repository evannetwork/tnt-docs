We would like to give you some tools to evaluate and organize your data in TRUST&TRACE. 

We would like to start with the topics.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "What is a Topic?"
}
[/block]
Topics enable users to organize their requests to gain a better overview. Combine your requests into one topic and find the information and shared data you are looking for at a glance.
With TRUST&TRACE Topic management you can create an individual "folder" structures for your company. A topic is always private and not shared with other parties.

You decide which information you want to assign to topics. No data is lost in the process. You can always see the complete information exchange in your partners activity stream.

In TRUST&TRACE you have the possibility to make settings to adjust your data or your workflow. 
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Navigation"
}
[/block]
For example, to get a larger workspace, you can collapse the navigation so that you only see the logos. This gives you more space for evaluations and tables.

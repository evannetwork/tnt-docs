Contacts are your business partners, that you can communicate with via the DIDCOMM protocol. To share certificates, both parties (sender and receiver) need to have the other party in their contacts. Adding contacts has three steps:

- [Create a Contact] entry for you (which is basically like an entry in your mobile phone's address book)
- you send a business partner an invitation, signalling that you want to cooperate with him or her: [Invite a Contact] (which could be compared to giving your phone number to someone) 
- the partner accepts the invitation, which allows secure communication between you two, this can only be done from the [TRUST&TRACE UI] at the moment (continuing with the mobile phone example, your business partner adds you to his or her address book)
